## 1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By accessing, using, or interacting with the PROVION Protocol (the "Protocol"), including but not limited to smart contracts, user interfaces, documentation, or any related services (collectively, the "Services"), you ("User", "you", or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions ("Terms").

**IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE PROTOCOL.**

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the PROVION development team (the "Team", "we", "us", or "our"). The Team may update these Terms at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Protocol after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

---

## 2. DEFINITIONS

- **"Protocol"**: The PROVION autonomous meritocracy protocol, including all smart contracts, infrastructure, and associated software.
- **"Smart Contracts"**: Self-executing code deployed on blockchain networks, including but not limited to Arbitrum Orbit Layer 3.
